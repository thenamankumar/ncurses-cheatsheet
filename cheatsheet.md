# A Handy Ncurses Cheatsheet
A handy cheatsheet for programmers working with [ncurses library by GNU](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/). Complete inshort documentation and usage details. This is a reference doc which will help you in the process of building up great interactive command line projects using the ncurses library by GNU.


## How to install ncurses
Well installing ncurses library is an easy task, you just have to follow the steps listed below:

### Installing ncurses on Debian/Ubuntu Linux
1. `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

### Installing ncurses on Mac OS X
1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (if not already):
`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
2. Install ncurses package: `$brew install homebrew/dupes/ncurses`


## How to link ncurses with project

Command structure: `g++ ${file} -o ${file_path}/${file_base_name} -lncurses`

Example: `gcc main.cpp -o main -lncurses`


## Initialization Functions

|Functions|Discription|
|-------------|-------------|
|initscr()|Initializes the terminal in cursor mode. It must be called first to do any manupulation with ncurses package.|
|refresh()|Tell the curses system to dump the contents on the screen. It checks the window and updates only the portion which has been changed.|
|wrefresh()|Tell the curses system to dump the contents on the given window. It checks the given window and updates only the portion which has been changed.|
